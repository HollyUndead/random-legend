    "description": "When Alter emerged from her dimension into another (with her past held close to the chest), she had only two things: her interdimensional traveling Void tech, and a desire to have fun. She stole the fanciest of foods, learned to fight through dicey situations, and took on odd jobs for personal favors–though she didn’t have a problem double-crossing her clients if it was more beneficial or amusing. Never needing to stick around for the consequences of her actions eroded any sense of morality or responsibility she had. She could focus on what was important: making sure life was never mundane. Alter was drawn to worlds on the edge of complete destruction. Whether something devastating was already happening or she helped usher in the apocalypse herself, she was there to watch whatever catastrophe ensued. It was only in those moments, after all, that people took off the masks they always wore and she could see their true selves. Finding these world-ending events was a toss up. Sometimes she’d find what she was looking for, and on others, she’d have missed the main event in worlds already ruined. But in some of these ruined worlds, Alter began to notice an interesting commonality… Many of these worlds hadn’t met their end by some random event; they had been destroyed by the same person."

It was the perfect job for Reid, who infiltrated and psychologically manipulated the researchers for years. When the lab self-destructed, she died. /And didn’t. /Her brain was put in a simulacrum shell, but in the process, she lost years of memories, and the trauma of her “death” caused her personality to fracture.

After an encounter with Horizon that overrides Ash’s simulacrum programming, the framework that kept the vulnerable--yet intelligent--Leigh personality dormant has begun to crack. Ash joins the Games to prove she has transcended all humanity. Leigh’s determined to prove her wrong."

Sok Leng and her brother Kit Siang were an inseparable duo of destruction, and with August now in their squad, they seemed unstoppable. But nothing lasts forever. August’s crowd-pandering combat style meant he wasn’t paying attention to his team when they needed him, leading to Kit Siang’s death.

    "description": "Wraith is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute deadly attacks and manipulate spacetime by opening rifts in the fabric of reality — but those abilities came at a price. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC detention facility with no memory of who she was. Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered as guinea pig for her own experiments... whose partner betrayed her and locked her away… no longer existed. All that was left was a timid girl, frightened by a cacophony of voices in her head, until another version of herself appeared and taught her to listen to the voices. Following her lead, Wraith found the strength to break free from her prison and escape into a different reality - this reality. /Finally free, but still robbed of her memories, Wraith continues her quest to learn more about who she was before the experiments. With so many of the Apex Games held on old IMC bases, Wraith now competes so she can access the mysterious facilities and continue to learn more about who she was. She remains a fixture of the Apex Games, and with every match she gets closer to the truth, even if she sometimes feels scared to find out more about who she used to be."
